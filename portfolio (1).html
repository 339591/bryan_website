      <td>For the Spectrum V project we had to watch a series of videos learning about CSS and HTML and this was the cap stone project. Everything we learned throughout the videos were implemented into the creating of that website. Through the use of different HTML tags and CSS, I was able to get the image above. (Click on image to see glimpse of CSS file) </td>
      <td>In this assignment we had to look up different operating systems and download them into virtual boxes. We used old computers and downloaded the operating systems onto the computers. We tried them out as if it were the operating system meant for that computer </td>
      <td>For this project we had to learn the basics of python in order to make a story that has multiple ending. The story I chose was Macbeth and what it would be like to choose his own ending. In the story the story the user makes decisions which would ultimately end differently with every decision.(click on link to image to play the game)</td>
